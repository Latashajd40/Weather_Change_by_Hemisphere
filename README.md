This repository contains a WeatherPy directory and the files contained within are below:
    -output_data directory
       -cities.csv it contains weather information for each city returned from OpenWeatherMap
       -Fig1.png is a graph of City Max Latitude vs Temperature
       -Fig2.png is a graph of City Latitude vs. Humidity 
       -Fig3.png is a graph of City Latitude vs. Cloudiness
       -Fig4.png is a graph of City Latitude vs Wind Speed

    -There are also 2 hidden files containing api keys for Open Weather Map and Geoapify

WeatherPy
The purpose of this assignment was to be able to use data to determine the answers to various questions
about weather.  The relationships between latitude vs. temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed are 
examined.  Additionally, to further examine the relationships linear regression is completed for each 
relationship by hemisphere.  After each pair of graphs for the northern and southern hemisphere there is a 
brief analysis of the relationship.

VacationPy
The purpose of this assignment is to take the information above and apply it to a practical situation.  In this
part the city data is used to find ideal vacation areas based on weather preference.  Given the time of year, the 
selection of preference was based on what are the best conditions given the season. In this file you will see 2 
charts one with all of the cities graphed and one with just the cities with the ideal weather preference.  You
will also be able to hover each city and find information that pertains to that location.
